# Picking Routes

This service is designed to simplify how products are assigned to their dynamic picking routes. It allows for the management of picking routes across multiple venues, complete with API endpoints for user and venue oversight, providing flexibility in operations at various locations.

### Overview
The goal of this project is to streamline picking route management for different venues. It automatically allocates products to their respective picking routes, which helps improve efficiency and reduce delays. While it presently operates as a back-end service with available API endpoints, it sets the stage for more extensive applications in inventory and route management.
